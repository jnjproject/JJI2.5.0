## Reading Hyperion Reports

After you run your tests, a report will be created. You can find this report in the *output/reports/allure* folder where the base tests repository is found. Due to changes in how browsers handle local javascript files, you will now need to start a webserver on the reports folder in order for you to see the report via a local browser.


```
├── output
│   └── reports
│       ├── allure <- this is where the index.html of the report resides
```

1. Start a Webserver via Python3 (or any webserver of your choice)

```
/your-tests-folder/output/reports/allure
13:42 $ python -m http.server 6789
``` 

2. Open the reports page by opening your browser to http://localhost:6789
